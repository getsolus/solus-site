This is our second daily ISO, which features more hardware support, a slight visual refresh, along with some core bug fixes. This came a few hours late due to some technical issues, an ISO for July 1st will be issued this evening. (Timezones are relative. :])

Main changes:

- UEFI dual-boot issues resolved.
- Issue with network hostname change preventing application launches resolved.
- Updated firmware package, supporting more devices (Intel WiFi, Radeon GPU, Tegra GPU).
- 4.1.1 LTS kernel.
- Trial-run of [Arc GTK theme](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme).

See our first daily ISO announcement for instructions on writing this 64-bit, Hybrid, UEFI-compatible ISO to USB medium. Remember, **unetbootin is not supported!**
