Welcome to This Week in Solus, Installation #13. 

Wait, isn't this supposed to be an unlucky number?

#### Daily Images

Let's kick off TWIS with talk about Daily Images. As you might have known, we released [Daily Image 0.201549.3.0](https://solus-project.com/2015/12/02/daily-iso-0-201549-3-0-released/)last Wednesday, but what you might not have known is we also released 
0.2015.49.5.0.

That's right, **two** images this week.

Thanks to the continued support from the Solus community, Community Manager Justin was able to obtain an AMD HD 5450 Silent to enable us to better test AMD proprietary driver support when it lands.
